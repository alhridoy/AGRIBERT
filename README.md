# AgriBERT: Agricultural Question Answering System

## Description

This project implements a fine-tuned BERT model for agricultural question answering. It uses the `recobo/agriculture-bert-uncased` model, which is pre-trained on agricultural texts, and further fine-tunes it on a custom dataset of agricultural questions and answers.

## Features

- Utilizes a BERT model pre-trained on agricultural texts
- Fine-tunes the model on a custom agricultural Q&A dataset
- Implements a question-answering system for agricultural domain questions
- Evaluates the model's performance on the Q&A task

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
